## 📱 How It Works

### Single Device Setup

1. **Open the app** (local or deployed URL)
2. **Click "Start Swiping!"**
3. **You swipe first** (sees "👤 Parent 1" in top-right)
4. **Click the parent button** to switch
5. **Your wife swipes** (now shows "👤 Parent 2")
6. **Click "Matches" tab** to see names you both loved! 💕

### Parent Switcher

The button in the top-right corner switches who's swiping:

```
👤 Parent 1  ←→  👤 Parent 2
```

Each person's swipes are saved separately. Matches appear when both like the same name!
